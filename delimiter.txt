Consider the following operation applied to possitive integer values: if the number is even, then halve it, butif the number is odd,
 then multiply it by three and add one. thus the operation applied to 16 yields 8, while applied to 7 yields 22.
the Syracuse sequence with starting point n, 
begins with n itself and each subsequent element is obtained by applying the above operation to the one before untit value one is reached, 
at which point the sequence ends. For example the sequence with starting point 3 is 3,10,5,16,8,4,2,1. 
Here are the sequence for starting points one to twelve
